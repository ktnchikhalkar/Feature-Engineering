I want you to keep in mind that There is no rule of thumb to indicate which method you should use to encode categorical variables. It is mostly up to what makes sense for the data, and it also depends on what you are trying to achieve. In general, for data competitions, we value more model predictive power, whereas in business scenarios we want to capture and understand the information, and generally, we want to transform variables in a way that it makes 'Business sense'. Some of your common sense and a lot of conversation with the people that understand the data well will be required to encode categorical labels.\n"
